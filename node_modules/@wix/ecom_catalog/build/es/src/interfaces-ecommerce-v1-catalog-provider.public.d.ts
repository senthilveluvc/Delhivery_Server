     *
     * Retrieves data for specified items in a specified catalog.
     *
     * Wix calls this method whenever a cart or checkout is updated, and when an item is added to an order.
     *
     * The method receives a `catalogReferences` array. Each catalog reference in the array contains:
     * + The ID of the item whose latest information Wix needs to retrieve.
     * + The ID of the app providing the catalog containing the item.
     * + Optional details about preferences or customization of the item.
     *
     * The method also receives preferences for the currency and weight unit to be used in the response.
     *
     * Your external catalog can store and organize item details in any way you prefer.
     * When implementing the Catalog service plugin, learn how to [handle item variants](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/business-solutions/e-commerce/catalog-service-plugin/handle-item-variants) in a way that meets your needs.
     *
     * The method's response must contain a `catalogItems` array. Each item in the array must contain:
     * + A `catalogReference` object. This must be identical to the `catalogReference` object received in the request.
     * + A `data` object with full details about the item.
     *
     * > **Notes:**
     * > + If an item doesn't exist in the catalog, the response must exclude it from the `catalogItems` array in the response.
     * > + When none of the items requested exist in the catalog, `catalogItems` must contain an empty array.
     * > + Wix calls the method every time a cart or checkout is updated. If the response doesn't include an item that was already in the cart or checkout, Wix removes the item from the cart or checkout.
