/**
 * Creates a query to retrieve a list of tip distributions.
 *
 * The `queryTipDistributions()` function builds a query to retrieve a list of tip distributions and returns a `TipDistributionsQueryBuilder` object.
 *
 * The returned object contains the query definition, which is typically used to run the query using the [find()](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/ecom/tips/tip-distributions-query-builder/find) function.
 *
 * You can refine the query by chaining `TipDistributionsQueryBuilder` functions onto the query. `TipDistributionsQueryBuilder` functions enable you to sort, filter, and control the results that `queryTipDistributions()` returns.
 *
 * `queryTipDistributions()` runs with the following `TipDistributionsQueryBuilder` default that you can override:
 *
 * + `limit` is `50`
 *
 * The functions that are chained to `queryTipDistributions()` are applied in the order they are called. For example, if you apply `ascending("transaction.transactionDate")` and then `ascending("staff.id")`, the results are sorted first by the `"transaction.transactionDate"`, and then, if there are multiple results with the same `"transaction.transactionDate"`, the items are sorted by `"staff.id"`.
 *
 * When setting a date filter remember to use
 * [UTC time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time).
 *
 * The following `TipDistributionsQueryBuilder` functions are supported for the `queryTipDistributions()` function. For a full description of the tip distributions object, see the object returned for the [items](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/ecom/tips/tip-distributions-query-result/items) property in `TipDistributionsQueryResult`.
