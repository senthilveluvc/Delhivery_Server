/**
 * Creates a query to retrieve a list of discount rules.
 *
 *
 * The `queryDiscountRules()` function builds a query to retrieve a list of up to 100 discount rules, and returns a [`DiscountRulesQueryBuilder`](#discountrulesquerybuilder) object.
 *
 * The returned object contains the query definition which is typically used to run the query using the [`find()`](/discount-rules/discount-rules-query-builder/find) function.
 *
 * You can refine the query by chaining `DiscountRulesQueryBuilder` functions onto the query. `DiscountRulesQueryBuilder` functions enable you to sort, filter, and control the results queryDiscountRules() returns.
 *
 * By default, `queryDiscountRules()` sorts results by [`ascending("_id")`](/discount-rules/discount-rules-query-builder/ascending) by default. This can be overridden.
 *
 * To learn how to query posts, refer to the table below.
 *
 * The following `DiscountRulesQueryBuilder` functions are supported for the `queryDiscountRules()` function. For a full description of the discount rule object, see the object returned for the [`items`](/discount-rules/discount-rules-query-result/items) property in the `DiscountRulesQueryResult`.
