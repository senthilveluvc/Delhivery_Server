/**
 * Creates a query to retrieve a list of tip settings.
 *
 * The `queryTipSettings()` function builds a query to retrieve a list of tip settings and returns a `TipSettingsQueryBuilder` object.
 *
 * The returned object contains the query definition, which is typically used to run the query using the [find()](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/ecom/tip-settings/tip-settings-query-builder/find) function.
 *
 * You can refine the query by chaining `TipSettingsQueryBuilder` functions onto the query. `TipSettingsQueryBuilder` functions enable you to sort, filter, and control the results that `queryTipSettings()` returns.
 *
 * `queryTipSettings()` runs with the following `TipSettingsQueryBuilder` default that you can override:
 *
 * + `limit` is `50`.
 * + Sorted by `id` in ascending order.
 *
 * The functions that are chained to `queryTipSettings()` are applied in the order they are called. For example, if you apply `ascending("tipType")` and then `ascending("locationId")`, the results are sorted first by the `"tipType"`, and then, if there are multiple results with the same `"tipType"`, the items are sorted by `"locationId"`.
 *
 * The following `TipSettingsQueryBuilder` functions are supported for the `queryTipSettings()` function. For a full description of the tip settings object, see the object returned for the [items](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/ecom/tip-settings/tip-settings-query-result/items) property in `TipSettingsQueryResult`.
